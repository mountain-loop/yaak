# Yaak CLI NPM Packages

The Rust `yaak` CLI binary is published to NPM with a meta package (`@yaakapp/cli`) and
platform-specific optional dependency packages. The package exposes both `yaak` and `yaakcli`
commands for compatibility.

This follows the same strategy previously used in the standalone `yaak-cli` repo.
