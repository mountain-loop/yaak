# Contributing to Yaak

Yaak accepts community pull requests for:

- Bug fixes
- Small-scope improvements directly tied to existing behavior

Pull requests that introduce broad new features, major redesigns, or large refactors are out of scope unless explicitly approved first.

## Approval for Non-Bugfix Changes

If your PR is not a bug fix or small-scope improvement, include a link to the approved [feedback item](https://yaak.app/feedback) where contribution approval was explicitly stated.

## Development Setup

For local setup and development workflows, see [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md).
